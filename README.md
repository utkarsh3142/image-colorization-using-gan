# image-colorization-using-gan
Implemented a GAN to colorize grayscale images on 101flowers dataset

This implementation is partially based on my previous project on DCGAN (https://github.com/utkarsh3142/dcgan-cartoonset-data) and 
Tensorflow Pix2Pix tutorial. I have implemented a Pix2Pix model with PatchGAN discriminator and U-Net encoder decoder generator.
